# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite User Management Application

This project is a User Management Application built using Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses the Pinia library for state management and Vue Router for routing. The application fetches user data from an API, and allows for viewing, adding, and deleting users.

The project is set up with a focus on type safety and developer experience, with TypeScript for static type checking and Vite for fast, unbundled development. The project also includes a global SCSS setup for styling.

- Vue 3 (`^3.3.4`): A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript (`^5.0.2`): A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- Vite (`^4.4.5`): A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
